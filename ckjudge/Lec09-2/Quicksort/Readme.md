------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. You may have learnt
it in PD1 class, but if you want to understand it better, the best way
is to implement it yourself!

The algorithm of quicksort could be describe as following:

1\. You have an unsorted array, the index of first element is called
\"low\", and the index of the last one is called \"high\".

2\. Arbitrarily pick a number from the given array as \"pivot\". The
\"pivot\" is used to \"divide\" the array into two sub-arrays, according
to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. In this
question, **we require you to always pick the last number in array as
\"pivot\"**.

3\. Iterate through the array (except the \"pivot\") to find the index of
\"pivot\". **In this iteration, we keep moving the numbers that are
smaller than \"pivot\" or equal to \"pivot\" to the front of the array,
and keep track of the index of the last number of them**. After we
finishing iterating, the index of \"pivot\" is next to the last number
that is smaller than it.

4\. **Move \"pivot\" to the position we found in step 2**. At this point,
you have \"divide\" the original array into two sub-arrays, but they
both are still unsorted.

5\. Repeat step 1 - 4 on two sub-arrays recursively, **until you find the
length of divided sub-array is 1 or 0**, which is trivially sorted.

We can illustrate this process with array `8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6`:

       l                  h
    1. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // you have an unsorted array, the first index is low, the last is high

       l                  h
    2. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // pick the last one as "pivot", in this case, it is 6
                          p

       l                  h
    3. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // move those numbers that are smaller than 6 to the front
       i                  p
       8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 8 is bigger than 6, no action
     s i                  p
       5 8 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 5 is smaller than 6, move to the front
       s i                p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 1 is smaller than 6, move to the front
         s i              p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 9 is bigger than 6, no action
         s   i            p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 10 is bigger than 6, no action
         s      i         p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 7 is bigger than 6, no action
         s        i       p
       5 1 3 9 10 7 8 2 4 6 // 3 is smaller than 6, move to the front
           s        i     p
       5 1 3 2 10 7 8 9 4 6 // 2 is smaller than 6, move to the front
             s        i   p
       5 1 3 2 4 7 8 9 10 6 // 4 is smaller than 6, move to the front
               s        i p

       l                  h
    4. 5 1 3 2 4 6 8 9 10 7 // move "pivot" to the center of two sub-arrays
                 p

       l       h
    5. 5 1 3 2 4 6 8 9 10 7 // repeat it on sub-arrays recursively
               p
    -> 1 3 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 7
             p

    ...

    5. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // Sorted!

It is better that we can trace the sorting process with our eye than
with our mind. So besides implementing the sorting algorithm above, **we
need you to print out the result of step 4 everytime you \"conquer\" the
sub problem**. You need to use bracket `[ ]` to show the range of
sub-array, and put asterisk `*` in front of the pivot in that sub-array.
Please refer to the sample output.

Hope you can totally understand this cool algorithm after this exercise
:D

### Input

The first line is an integer n (1 \<= n \<= 500), indicating the number
of numbers in the given array. The following line is an unsorted array
with n integer numbers. Notice that there may be duplicated value in the
array.

### Output

The process of quick sort, line by line. And the final line is the
sorted array. Please refer to samples.

### Loader Code

<div>

Your code will be judge using this program:

</div>

    #include <‍stdio.h>
    #define N 500
    #define swap(x, y) {int tmp = x; x = y; y = tmp;}

    void quicksort(int a[], int low, int high);
    int partition(int a[], int low, int high);

    int size;

    int main(void)
    {
        int array[N];
        scanf("%d", &size);

        for (int i = 0; i <‍ size; i++)
        {
            scanf("%d", &array[i]);
        }

        quicksort(array, 0, size - 1);

        for (int i = 0; i <‍ size; i++)
        {
            printf("%d ", array[i]);
        }
        return 0;
