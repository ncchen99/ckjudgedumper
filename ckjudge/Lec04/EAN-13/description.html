<h2>EAN-13</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
<p>In Taiwan, manufacturers of goods put a barcode on each product. This code identifies both the manufacturer and the product. Among a variety of different formats of the barcodes, one of these is known as EAN-13, which represents a thirteen-digit number. For example: 4 710367 663270.</p><p>The EAN-13 is composed of the following four components:</p><ol><li><p>GS1 prefix: The first three digits usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.</p></li><li><p>Manufacturer code: This is a unique code (variable-length) assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix.</p></li><li><p>Product code: The product code, which immediately follows manufacturer code, is assigned by the manufacturer.</p></li><li><p>Check digit: This is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly.</p></li></ol><p>To calculate the check digit, follow the three steps below:</p><ol><li><p>Numbering the positions from the right (exclude check digit), the odd positions in the twelve-digit number are weight of 3 and the even positions are weight of 1. Multiply each data digit with its corresponding weight.</p><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p>data: 4 7 1 0 3 6 7 6 6 3 2 7</p><p>weight: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Calculate the sum of the results from step 1.</p></li><li><p>Subtract the sum from <strong>the nearest multiple of 10 that is equal to or higher than the sum (see hint)</strong>. The result is the check digit.</p></li></ol><p>Write a program that calculate the check digit.</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number</a></p>
